# xlladdin

A collection of Excel add-ins.

The `xlladdins.sln` contains all the add-in projects. 

Define `SHFB_DOCS` in `xll12` to put the documentation in `docs` in the solution folder.

Run the debug version of an add-in to generate documentation.

Use the `docs/docs.sln` to build the documentation.

Github will make them available [here](https://xlladdins.github.io/main/)
